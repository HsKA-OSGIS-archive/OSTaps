-- DJANGO INSTALLATION --
! make sure python and its pip are in windows system variable

pip install django

-- CREATE PROJECT --
django-admin startproject backend
! in this folder you find the manage.py script which starts the server
! as well as the "backend" folder where the python files are stored

-- CREATE HTML-PAGE AND DISPLAY IT --
! create a folder "frontend" in the folder structure where the manage.py
! script and the "backend" folder is stored. In this you can create a html-files
! named index.html e.g.

<html>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World!</p>   
  </body>
</html>

! the backend now needs to know where the frontend is located. In the settings.py
! file in the "backend" folder you find the TEMPLATES entry with an empty 'DIRS': []
! -> in the square brackets add
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'frontend')
! now the backend knows where your html templates are located.

! the backend now needs to know how to handle client requests.
! in the "backend" folder create a python file views.py with the content 

from django.shortcuts import render
def index (request):
	return render(request, 'index.html')
	
! the backend now knows what to response if the index method is called 
! (namely to render index.html).

! the URLs which define which view is loaded are defined in the backends urls.py
! here we first need to import the views folder 
from . import views

! and then add the index url which sends the request to the index method of views.py
url(r'^index/', views.index),

-- RUN SERVER --
! open cmd and navigate to the folder where the manage.py is located. Call
python manage.py runserver
! to start the server and open localhost:8000/index to view the created html page!
! to be able to open the index page without calling /index but only the domain change 
url(r'^index/', views.index),
! to 
url(r'^$', views.index),
! now localhost:8000 will render the index.html page

! this can be shortened with a .bat file like startServer.bat which includes 
start "" http://127.0.0.1:8000/index
python manage.py runserver
