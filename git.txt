////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers
Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:

        git init 											creates a new Git repository in the actual directory (cd)
        git status 											inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
        git add example.txt									adds files from the working directory to the staging area
		//do some changes
        git diff example.txt								shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
        git commit -m "beschreibung" 						permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
        git log 											shows a list of all previous commits
		git clone git://github.com/schacon/grit.git mygrit	clone the repository on github
		git add --help										get help to an command
		git mv test.txt firsttest.txt						move (change name) and automaticly add into staging area:

		git show HEAD   				 					HEAD is at the most recent commit
		git checkout HEAD filename		 					discard changes, resore file as last commit

multiple file contoll:

		git add data1.txt data2.txt      					add multiple files to the staging area
		git reset HEAD data1.txt 	    					unstage a file from the staging area

resetting commits:

		git log							 					see commits, press q if there are to much commits
		git reset 5d69206				 					first 7 digits of the SHA of the commit
		--> HEAD goes to a previously made commit 
							

		git checkout HEAD filename  						Discards changes in the working directory.
		git reset HEAD filename 							Unstages file changes in the staging area.
		git reset commit_SHA 								Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.

connect to GitHub Repository:

		git remote add origin https://github.com/flyEagelsfly/GITtest.git
		
		add all versioned files:
		git add -u




branching:

git branch
git branch new_branch                       // create new branch
git checkout new_branch                     // change to new branch
//make changes
git checkout master                         // change to master branch
git merge new_branch -m "what have I done"  // merge branch with master
